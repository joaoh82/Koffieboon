# Koffieboon Game Engine

![Koffieboon Game Engine](images/Logo.png)


This engine is made from the ground up using C++ and supporting Vulkan.

# What is the plan?

Koffieboon is a 3D engine from the start, with most of it built from scratch taking inspiration from different learning sources. My plan is to have to code very well commented and whatever other documentation I find relevant to make the understand easy and be used as a learning source also.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Fully 3D engine with various lighting models and material types available (Basic 3d lighting, Physically-Based Rendering, etc.)
- [ ] Cross-platform support (Windows and later Linux and Mac)
- [ ] Multiple rendering backends:
    - [ ] Vulkan first
    - [ ] Eventually adding OpenGL and DirectX and potentially Metal
- [ ] Suite of editor tools - Maybe using https://avaloniaui.net/
- [ ] Asset/Game Code hot-reload support
- [ ] Physics
- [ ] 2D/3D Sound
- [ ] Full-fledged UI system
- [ ] Event system
- [ ] Standard Keyboard/Mouse input along with eventual GamePad input

## Platform support

Windows is initially supported but linux and macOS are planned to be on the roadmap. Android and iOS runtime support might become part of it at some point.

## Goal

My initial goal is to create a game engine capable of making games.

My ultimate goal is to be able to use this engine to at least build a full game that can be published to a public platform like Steam or itch.io so other people can play it. And initially at least use the engine to participate in a couple of game jams with it.

But most importantly, I want to use this project as source of learning more about game development and game engine development.
